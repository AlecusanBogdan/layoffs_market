However, overall performance did not meet expectations for a senior C# developer.
Task velocity was consistently below the expected level, and extended cycle times and PR durations led to significant delivery delays. Daily updates during scrum meetings lacked clarity and structure, making it difficult to track progress or identify blockers. This had a direct impact on sprint planning and team coordination.
Proactivity in taking on tasks and surfacing issues was low, and communication around task status remained vague throughout the year. These gaps created uncertainty and reduced the team’s ability to plan accurately and respond quickly.
Several key objectives remain in progress, including technical excellence, efficiency, and company strategy alignment. Notably, the number of commits impacted by GenAI tools dropped by 53% in H2, indicating a need for more consistent engagement with innovation efforts.
To improve, Mihai is expected to:

Increase the speed and consistency of task delivery
Develop a more self-organized and accountable workflow
Communicate clearly and consistently during scrum meetings, including task status, progress, blockers, and estimations

While he typically maintains a quiet presence, his impact has been anything but silent.
He successfully completed all core objectives, including technical excellence, efficiency, and engagement, executing his tasks flawlessly and always on time. His work on monitoring dashboards and integration tests was solid and dependable.
What truly set Ionut apart this year was his willingness to step outside his comfort zone. He actively supported his colleagues through training, took on responsibilities from his manager, and even temporarily led his team during an absence. These were not easy tasks for him, but through perseverance and dedication, he handled them with maturity and effectiveness.
His initiative in supporting team operations and his consistent delivery of high-quality work make him a standout contributor. While his GenAI usage and commit impact slightly decreased in H2, this was expected given the nature and complexity of the tasks he took on.
Ionut is a key member of the team, and his growth this year clearly justifies the Excellent rating. He’s dependable, skilled, and continues to evolve into a well-rounded professional.', '2025-11-25 09:00:53.636', '2025-11-25 09:00:53.636', '2025-11-25 11:50:56.642', 'excellent', null);

While the first part of the year came with some challenges around delivery consistency and office presence, he managed to overcome these and finish strong.
He successfully met his efficiency and engagement objectives, showing improved productivity and maintaining a solid participation rate in Client Clans. His alignment with company strategy was also evident, with GenAI usage increasing from occasional in H1 to often in H2 with a 6% increase in commits assisted by AI.
Several objectives remain in progress, including technical excellence, test coverage, training, and TeamCity job maintenance. These will require further input and evaluation from the tech lead. His personal goal to complete a small server task is still pending and should be revisited in the next cycle.

His dedication, attention to detail, and proactive mindset made a real difference in the quality and stability of our application.
He successfully completed all objectives, including technical excellence, efficiency, engagement, training, and company strategy alignment. His work fixing memory leaks and silent crashes had a direct and positive impact on user experience and app store ratings—issues that were never reported but could have caused major problems if left unresolved.
Max also contributed significantly to team dynamics. He’s the go-to person for both his teammates and colleagues from other disciplines, always ready to help without hesitation. His attitude and work ethic inspire others to raise their own standards, and he does all this with humility and professionalism.
Even though his GenAI usage frequency dropped slightly in H2, he still achieved a 22% increase in commits impacted by GenAI tools, showing continued engagement with innovation while focusing on high-impact tasks.
Max is a standout performer whose contributions go far beyond expectations. His technical depth, initiative, and team-first mindset make him a key asset, and his performance this year fully justifies the Excellent rating.

From day one, he showed a high level of proactivity, stepping into complex challenges and contributing real value across multiple areas.
He successfully completed all core objectives, including efficiency, engagement, training, and technical excellence. His ability to quickly understand and deliver on a wide range of features has made a noticeable impact. Despite working on highly complex tasks, which naturally affected his GenAI commit count, Daniel maintained a strong pace and quality of work throughout.
Beyond the expected scope, Daniel took initiative to build a script that automatically generates linked PRs for submodules—an improvement that significantly reduces manual effort and human error. He also led the lobby cleanup initiative, creating and executing a clear plan. With 75% of the work already completed, most of it driven by Daniel, this effort stands out as a major contribution to team efficiency and codebase health.

From day one, he showed a high level of proactivity, stepping into complex challenges and contributing real value across multiple areas.
He successfully completed all core objectives, including efficiency, engagement, training, and technical excellence. His ability to quickly understand and deliver on a wide range of features has made a noticeable impact. Despite working on highly complex tasks, which naturally affected his GenAI commit count, Daniel maintained a strong pace and quality of work throughout.
Beyond the expected scope, Daniel took initiative to build a script that automatically generates linked PRs for submodules—an improvement that significantly reduces manual effort and human error. He also led the lobby cleanup initiative, creating and executing a clear plan. With 75% of the work already completed, most of it driven by Daniel, this effort stands out as a major contribution to team efficiency and codebase health.

He tends to work quietly and independently, which contributes to his reliability and steady output.
He successfully met his efficiency and engagement objectives, showing improved productivity and maintaining strong participation in Client Clans. His alignment with company strategy was particularly notable—he significantly increased his use of GenAI tools, with commits impacted rising from 30 in H1 to 118 in H2, a 393% increase. His usage frequency also shifted from occasional to regular, showing clear progress in adopting new technologies.
Bogdan also stepped out of his comfort zone by participating in the Shark Tank competition, where he presented a feature idea with potential business impact. This initiative reflects a growing willingness to contribute beyond his core responsibilities.
Some objectives, including technical excellence, training, and his personal goal in Machine Learning, remain in progress or pending and will need further follow-up with the tech lead.

However, overall performance did not meet expectations for a senior C# developer.
Task velocity was consistently below the expected level, and extended cycle times and PR durations led to significant delivery delays. Daily updates during scrum meetings lacked clarity and structure, making it difficult to track progress or identify blockers. This had a direct impact on sprint planning and team coordination.
Proactivity in taking on tasks and surfacing issues was low, and communication around task status remained vague throughout the year. These gaps created uncertainty and reduced the team’s ability to plan accurately and respond quickly.
Several key objectives remain in progress, including technical excellence, efficiency, and company strategy alignment. Notably, the number of commits impacted by GenAI tools dropped by 53% in H2, indicating a need for more consistent engagement with innovation efforts.
To improve, Mihai is expected to:

Increase the speed and consistency of task delivery
Develop a more self-organized and accountable workflow
Communicate clearly and consistently during scrum meetings, including task status, progress, blockers, and estimations

These areas require focused attention and support going forward. Improvement is necessary to meet the standards expected at this level and to contribute effectively to team goals.', '2025-11-25 09:00:53.701', '2025-11-25 09:00:53.701', '2025-11-25 11:50:56.676', 'needs-improvement', null);

However, overall performance did not meet expectations for a senior C# developer.
Task velocity was consistently below the expected level, and extended cycle times and PR durations led to significant delivery delays. Daily updates during scrum meetings lacked clarity and structure, making it difficult to track progress or identify blockers. This had a direct impact on sprint planning and team coordination.
Proactivity in taking on tasks and surfacing issues was low, and communication around task status remained vague throughout the year. These gaps created uncertainty and reduced the team’s ability to plan accurately and respond quickly.
Several key objectives remain in progress, including technical excellence, efficiency, and company strategy alignment. Notably, the number of commits impacted by GenAI tools dropped by 53% in H2, indicating a need for more consistent engagement with innovation efforts.
To improve, Mihai is expected to:

Increase the speed and consistency of task delivery
Develop a more self-organized and accountable workflow
Communicate clearly and consistently during scrum meetings, including task status, progress, blockers, and estimations

These areas require focused attention and support going forward. Improvement is necessary to meet the standards expected at this level and to contribute effectively to team goals.', '2025-11-25 09:00:53.689', '2025-11-25 09:00:53.689', '2025-11-25 10:02:10.407', 'needs-improvement', null);
